                    The oldest operating McDonald's restaurant is the third one built, opened in 1953. It is located at
                    10207 Lakewood Blvd. at Florence Ave. in Downey, California (at 33.9471°N 118.1182°W).
                    Siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West
                    14th Street in San Bernardino, California, on May 15, 1940. The brothers introduced the "Speedee
                    Service System" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant
                    that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.[26][27] The
                    original mascot of McDonald's was a hamburger-headed chef who was referred to as "Speedee".[28] In
                    1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot.[29] Clown mascot Ronald McDonald
                    was introduced in 1963 to market the chain to children.[30]

                    Logo from 1953 until 1960
                    On May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name "McDonald's" with the
                    description "Drive-In Restaurant Services", which continues to be renewed. By September 13,
                    McDonald's, under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping,
                    double-arched "M" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used a single arch for the
                    architecture of their buildings. Although the "Golden Arches" logo appeared in various forms, the
                    present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was granted a U.S. trademark.

                    The present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc on April 15,
                    1955.[31] This was the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall, although this location was
                    destroyed and rebuilt in 1984.[clarification needed] Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive
                    business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.[32]

                    Kroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's
                    autobiography. In 1961, he purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and began the
                    company's worldwide reach.[33] The sale cost Kroc $2.7 million, a huge sum during that time.[32] The
                    San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down in 1971, and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo
                    chain in 1998. This area serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route
                    66 museum.[34][35] With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has
                    become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life.[36] Its prominence has
                    made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer
                    responsibility.</p>
